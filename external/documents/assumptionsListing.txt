Following are the assumptions made in the course of the problem practice:
1. The average rating was calculated in sumation of review_value_speed and review_value_print quality by two. 
2. Accepted percentage was calculated for the event order/execute/customer/status/payment which stands for the order acceptance from 
   supplier and customer can proceed with payment.
3. Traditional mechanism of reading the content from json object, processing and storing the putput to output table is considered.


New idea for data analysis:
1. To understand the type of customer requests, data analytics can be provided for event "context_traits_persona" which records the purpose
   of target user.
2. To determine the most requested type of manufacturer, event "orderStationManufacterer" can help us determine the rating, performance,
   responses and quality of product provided by supplier.
3. The graph on both the above category can help to come up with better target users and suppliers by providing graph of performance and 
   market publicity.
